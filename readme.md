### 🌟 About Me

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for building scalable, high-quality software solutions. With extensive experience in backend and full-stack web development, I specialize in PHP (Laravel 7-11), JavaScript, and modern web technologies. My journey has taken me through the development of various SaaS platforms, event management systems, subscription services, and e-commerce applications. 

I love creating efficient systems with microservices, cloud deployments (AWS, DigitalOcean, GCP), and setting up CI/CD pipelines for smooth and reliable deployments. Besides coding, I'm always eager to learn new technologies and dig deeper into challenging problems.
